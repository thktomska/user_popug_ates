Notes:
  - See the chart via [Lucid](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/c5b6957a-cf0b-4ad8-8035-5da5babd6364/edit?invitationId=inv_732145d6-3b4a-4d11-a6c3-e3617067849a&page=0_0#)
  - each Application (Task Tracker, Accounting, Analytics) has read & write DBs. And each Application has an access to read DB of any other Application while the write DB could be accessed by related Application.
  - I'm note sure about naming for events.
